# Ochi Clone Project

I recently completed a front-end clone project inspired by the award-winning website, Ochi. Leveraging Vite and React, along with the impressive capabilities of Locomotive.js for smooth scrolling, Framer Motion for animations, and Tailwind CSS for styling, I recreated the visually stunning Ochi site. While the clone is currently desktop-oriented and not yet responsive for mobile devices, this project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience with these cutting-edge technologies.

## Key Features

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented Locomotive.js for fluid and seamless scrolling transitions.
- **Animations**: Utilized Framer Motion to add captivating animations and interactions to the site.
- **Responsive Styling**: Leveraged Tailwind CSS to style the site, focusing on desktop layout with future plans for mobile responsiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development, providing an efficient development environment.
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, facilitating the creation of dynamic and interactive components.
- **Locomotive.js**: A smooth scroll JavaScript library that enhances user experience with elegant scrolling animations.
- **Framer Motion**: An animation library for React that enables the creation of fluid animations and interactive UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allowed for rapid styling and customization of the site's appearance.

## Future Goals

While the front-end clone of Ochi provided me with a solid foundation in animated front-end design, my journey doesn't end here. In the future, I plan to further explore and specialize in animated front-end development, diving deeper into advanced techniques and pushing the boundaries of interactive web experiences.
